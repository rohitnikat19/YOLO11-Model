# YOLO11-Model
Lab Assignment NO.03: Object Detection and Multi Object Classification (4 HOURS)-YOLO11 Model

## 1. Objective
The objective of this assignment is to implement object detection using a pre-trained model. YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) is used for detecting objects in images or video streams with high speed and accuracy.

## 2. Problem Definition
- **Dataset**: A custom dataset for object detection (e.g., vehicles, persons, or other labeled classes).
- **Task**: Use a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect and localize objects in the images.
- **Approach**: Use YOLOv5â€™s pretrained weights for inference or fine-tune on the custom dataset.

## 3. Methodology

### Pre-trained Model Used
- **Model**: YOLOv5 (v5s, v5m, or v5l depending on use-case)
- **Framework**: PyTorch

### Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Clone YOLOv5 repository
   - Install requirements using pip

2. **Prepare Dataset**:
   - Annotated in YOLO format (TXT files with class and bounding box info)
   - Images and labels organized under `train`, `val`, and `test` folders

3. **Load Pre-trained Model**:
   - Load YOLOv5 model with pre-trained weights from COCO dataset

4. **Train (Optional)**:
   - Fine-tune the model on the custom dataset

5. **Inference**:
   - Use `detect.py` to run inference and visualize detected objects

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyze metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision)

## 4. Libraries & Tools
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 (Ultralytics GitHub)
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## 5. Results
- Object detection results visualized with bounding boxes
- Accuracy and inference time recorded
- Detected classes and confidence scores shown
